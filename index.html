                <div id="dialogboxbody">
                    After nearly an entire year's worth of intense collaborative effort, the 7.24.0 major release of BRL-CAD is now available
                    for download! This is the alpha release unveiling of Archer/MGED, a preliminary interface update to BRL-CAD's
                    graphical geometry editor. Some highlights include an integrated graphical tree view, a single window
                    framework, drag and drop geometry editing, information panels, shortcut buttons, improved polygonal mesh
                    and 2D sketch editing, level of detail wireframes, NURBS shaded display support, and much more. As alpha
                    software, this new MGED prototype aims to provide functional feature parity with the antecedent MGED
                    interface while introducing changes. Prior to upcoming beta testing where the emphasis is predominantly
                    on stability and usability, this alpha status solicits feedback from the community on capability and
                    features. This release also includes various improvements to BRL-CAD's ray tracing infrastructure including
                    CPU thread affinity locking for faster performance, more consistent grazing hit behavior, expanded volume
                    and surface area calculations, numerous bug fixes, and more robust NURBS evaluation. Following BRL-CAD's
                    interface deprecation policy (see CHANGES file), the Jove text editor is no longer being bundled. Various
                    converters including the STEP, Patch, and 3DM importers received robustness improvements.

                <div id="dialogboxbody2">
                    In 1979, the U.S. Army Ballistic Research Laboratory (BRL) – now the United States Army Research Laboratory – expressed a
                    need for tools that could assist with the computer simulation and engineering analysis of combat vehicle
                    systems and environments. When no CAD package was found to be adequate for this purpose, BRL software
                    developers – led by Mike Muuss – began assembling a suite of utilities capable of interactively displaying,
                    editing, and interrogating geometric models. This suite became known as BRL-CAD. Development on BRL-CAD
                    as a package subsequently began in 1983; the first public release was made in 1984. BRL-CAD became an
                    open-source project on December, 2004. The BRL-CAD source code repository is believed to be the oldest
                    public version-controlled codebase in the world that's still under active development, dating back to
                    1983-12-16 00:10:31 UTC.

                    BRL-CAD was selected to participate in the 2013 Google Summer of Code Doc Camp. A team of contributors got together in California,
                    brainstormed, and wrote an entire book for BRL-CAD in just a few days. They created a guide for contributing
                    to BRL-CAD. BRL-CAD doc team getting to work writing a book
                    from scratch in less than three days. Contrary
                    to and perhaps because of longstanding efforts, people interested in improving BRL-CAD sometimes find
                    themselves lost in a sea of information. In all, BRL-CAD has more than a million words of documentation
                    across hundreds of manual pages, dozens of tutorials and examples, hundreds of wiki pages, dozens of
                    technical papers, and other resources. There are literally thousands of features. It's a lot, created
                    over decades of development. Over the course of a week in October, members from our community participated
                    in something fresh. Something different. Unconference brainstorming stickies A team of individuals traveled
                    from around the world to the Google headquarters in Mountain View, California, to participate in a 2-part
                    event: an unconference and a book sprint. Teams for GNOME, OpenMRS, and BRL-CAD arrived on the Google
                    campus and talked at length about techniques, tools, formats, documenters, and more. By the end of the
                    week, seven individuals from four different countries, three continents, and one oceanic island produced
                    a book for BRL-CAD totaling more than 100 pages in length. As free open source software, one of BRL-CAD's
                    greatest strength is that anyone can get involved and directly contribute. You can make it better. This
                    new book focuses on that aspect and introduces people to the project while providing detailed information
                    for developers, writers, artists, and other potential contributors. Fresh air break with Allen Gunn of
                    Aspiration and Adam Hyde of FLOSS Manuals This new effort kick-starts a campaign to dramatically improve
                    BRL-CAD's documentation, starting with this new contributor's guide. This guide will be available on
                    a website at a later date in electronic and printed form. Attending the camp provided an exciting opportunity
                    to get a grasp on new techniques for documenting and sharing information about our software, hopefully
                    in ways that help us grow our community. BRL-CAD's team included Sean Morrison, Eric Edwards, Cliff Yapp,
                    Harmanpreet Singh, Check Nyah, Isaac Kamga, and Scott Nesbitt. Thank you to the Google Open Source Programs

                    The BRL-CAD open source project is interested in a new logo so we're holding a competition for inspiring ideas from the community!
                    You have the chance to win cold cash, make friends, and obtain world-wide notoriety.There are cash prizes
                    for first, second, and third place selections plus an optional bonus. Winning selections will be announced
                    by August 15th. Pen and paper work just fine. Scan it in and e-mail it. You're welcome to use any tools
                    or software to design the logo. That said, you can double your prize amount IF (and only if) you design
                    a selected logo only using BRL-CAD tools. See here for an example of what I mean. If you're going for
                    the bonus, submit a ".g" geometry file in addition to any image file(s) you provide. In case you're wondering,
                    shoving an image into a .g doesn't count! With our steep learning curve, though, it's definitely not
                    for pansies nor recommended if you're a newbie. The bonus is just for the added awesome factor. The BRL-CAD
                    "mascot" is a moose. Feel free to incorporate that into your design or come up with something more abstract.
