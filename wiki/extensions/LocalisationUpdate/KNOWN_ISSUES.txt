Key issues at the moment:
* Seems to want to store a copy of the localization updates in each local database.
We've got hundreds of wikis run from the same installation set; we don't want to multiply our effort by 1000.

* It doesn't seem to be using available memcached stuff; unsure yet whether this is taken care of
by the general message caching or if we're going to end up making extra hits we don't need.
