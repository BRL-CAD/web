                            CIA Notify
                               v1.0
             http://brlcad.org/wiki/Extension:CIAnotify

This extension to Mediawiki sends change notifications to the CIA IRC
reporting system.  CIA relays change notifications in real time to a
project's IRC channel.  This extension works seamlessly and similar to
the other commit hook available for CIA.  See http://cia.vc for more
information about the CIA project.

To install CIA Notify:

1) Copy the extension to your Mediawiki extensions directory:
	cp -R CIAnotify /path/to/your/mediawiki/extensions/.

2) Edit LocalSettings.php, set cnProject and require the extension:
	$cnProject = 'BRL-CAD';
	require_once( "$IP/extensions/CIAnotify/CIAnotify.php" );

3) Enjoy!  Note that $cnProject needs to match your CIA project name.
   See http://cia.vc for more details.

The CIA Notify Mediawiki extension was originally written by
Christopher Sean Morrison ('brlcad' on Freenode) for the BRL-CAD open
source project.  Special thanks are deserved to Brian Koontz
('brianko' on Freenode) for inspiration.
