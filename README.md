BRL-CAD's primary website

BRL-CAD is a powerful computer graphics system for 3D computer-aided design and graphic visualization. Currently standing at more than a million lines of code and hundreds of staff years investment, BRL-CAD has been under development for 40 years (since 1979). It includes interactive solid geometry editing, ray-tracing support for rendering and geometric analysis, network-distributed framebuffer support, image and signal-processing tools, a system performance analysis benchmark suite, an embedded scripting interface, and a robust high-performance geometric representation and analysis library. BRL-CAD is represented, used, and developed by a collective of industry, academia, and government participants from all over the world.
